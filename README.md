A full stack React Native mobile application (Android/iOS) that allows users to interact with content through their unique profile. They can browse restaurant availability, create/review/delete bookings, as well as adding restaurants to their favourites.

## Technologies

These are the main technologies we used to contruct the project.

* ![ReactNative]
* ![Java]
* ![Spring]
* ![Hibernate]
* ![PostgreSQL]
* ![IntelliJ_IDEA]

## Brief

Our initial brief was extremely ambitious, due to the face we underestimated the challenges we would encounter using React Native. Below is a revised version of that brief!

**MVP**

A user should be able to:

- [x] Use filtered searches to check available tables at several restaurants
- [x] Book tables depending on restaurant availability
- [x] Review & delete any existing bookings
- [x] Add & remove restaurants to favourite list


**Extensions **

Some of the features currently in progress:

- [x] Multiple users should be able to log in to the app
- [ ] Restaurants should be able to log into a separate dashboard to customers
- [ ] Customer can search for restaurants nearby with location tracking
- [ ] Restaurants can respond to reviews
- [ ] Push notifications for customers when tables become available (at favourite restaurant)
- [ ] Multiple (human) languages

<br>

## Challenges

Here are some of the things we've found difficult:

* Learning a new framework while planning & building 
* File structuring & naming conventions as the project scaled up in size
* Managing dependency and version issues
* Build times

## Installation

Note: This setup tutorial assumes that you already have installed a package manager like npm and the version control system git.
**From Terminal:**

<b> The installation section of the README is currently under construction. </b>
